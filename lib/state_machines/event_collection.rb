    # * <tt>:from</tt> - One or more states being transitioned from.  If none
    #   are specified, then this will be the object's current state.
    # * <tt>:to</tt> - One or more states being transitioned to.  If none are
    #   specified, then this will match any to state.
    # * <tt>:on</tt> - One or more events that fire the transition.  If none
    #   are specified, then this will match any event.

    #   conditionals defined for each one.  Default is true.
