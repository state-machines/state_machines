  # Represents a collection of state machines for a class

    # Initializes the state of each machine in the given object.  This can allow
    # states to be initialized in two groups: static and dynamic.  For example:
    #
    #   machines.initialize_states(object) do
    #     # After static state initialization, before dynamic state initialization
    #   end
    #
    # If no block is provided, then all states will still be initialized.
    #
    # Valid configuration options:
    # * <tt>:static</tt> - Whether to initialize static states. Unless set to
    #   false, the state will be initialized regardless of its current value.
    #   Default is true.
    # * <tt>:dynamic</tt> - Whether to initialize dynamic states.  If set to
    #   :force, the state will be initialized regardless of its current value.
    #   Default is true.
    # * <tt>:to</tt> - A hash to write the initialized state to instead of
    #   writing to the object.  Default is to write directly to the object.
