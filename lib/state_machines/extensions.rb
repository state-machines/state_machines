  module InstanceMethods
    # Runs one or more events in parallel.  All events will run through the
    # following steps:
    # * Before callbacks
    # * Persist state
    # * Invoke action
    # * After callbacks
    #
    # For example, if two events (for state machines A and B) are run in
    # parallel, the order in which steps are run is:
    # * A - Before transition callbacks
    # * B - Before transition callbacks
    # * A - Persist new state
    # * B - Persist new state
    # * A - Invoke action
    # * B - Invoke action (only if different than A's action)
    # * A - After transition callbacks
    # * B - After transition callbacks
    #
    # *Note* that multiple events on the same state machine / attribute cannot
    # be run in parallel.  If this is attempted, an ArgumentError will be
    # raised.
    #
    # == Halting callbacks
    #
    # When running multiple events in parallel, special consideration should
    # be taken with regard to how halting within callbacks affects the flow.
    #
    # For *before* callbacks, any <tt>:halt</tt> error that's thrown will
    # immediately cancel the perform for all transitions.  As a result, it's
    # possible for one event's transition to affect the continuation of
    # another.
    #
    # On the other hand, any <tt>:halt</tt> error that's thrown within an
    # *after* callback with only affect that event's transition.  Other
    # transitions will continue to run their own callbacks.
    #
    # == Example
    #
    #   class Vehicle
    #     state_machine :initial => :parked do
    #       event :ignite do
    #         transition :parked => :idling
